<p>This website was created in early 2013 as a means to organize local events that help people actually bring life to the ideas that they would otherwise never have the time or resources to do alone.  A Product Rally is a convention of sorts, with a focus on helping people in a community help each other create the products they have always desired.  The organization and hosting of Product Rallies is in and of itself such a product.  It is the idea of one person who, without the help of others, would never have become a reality.</p>

<p>We all have ideas that we would love to bring to life someday.  Many of these ideas are too big for any one person to take on alone, others just take more time than we give ourselves, and some simply require skills that we don’t have.  What if there were a way to find people who want to help you make your idea real by providing a little bit of that extra effort?</p>

<p>The goal of Product Rally is to offer a way to find people in your community who are like you, people who want to see an idea become a reality, who just need a nudge in the right direction and perhaps a little help from a few others.  We are dedicated to bringing people together who want to create products, and not our own products even, but the products of those very people we bring together.</p>

<a id="how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How Does It Work?</h2>

<p>We have mentioned that a Product Rally is a convention of sorts.  Like many conventions, a Product Rally is a gathering of people, usually in a really big room.  Conventions usually have a theme to them and yes, Product Rallies have that too.  More specifically, the theme of a Product Rally is the type of product that will be developed over the duration of the event.  These rallies are typically held over the course of a long weekend.</p>

<p>Typically, months before the actual event will be held, the organizers pick a date, location, and type of product.  Once these basics are locked down, the organizers start to beseech those individuals who have ideas that they would like to turn into products to participate in the rally.  These individuals sign up for the rally by describing their idea and what kind of help they need.  Due to limitations in funds and venue, the number of projects that will be hosted may be limited.</p>

<p>When there is enough information about a project, it is listed on the Product Rally web site.  At this point, volunteers can peruse the list of projects and sign up for one.  On the day of the rally, everyone groups together into teams and start working on their respective projects.  The rally usually wraps up by celebrating everyone’s accomplishments.</p>

<p>Obviously there are a lot of details that are missing here but that’s because those details either aren’t as important or change from rally to rally.  In any case, you now have the general idea, time to try one out!</p>
