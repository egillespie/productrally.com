What a great day!

We had eight participants in total throughout the day and all of them were writers (unfortunately none of the dedicated editors that signed up were able to attend).  The enthusiasm and the quiet of focused writing made for a peculiar yet uplifting juxtaposition.  One minute everyone would be talking about story ideas and the next everyone would be heads-down and cranking out words.

Today we all learned just how much effort it takes to write something even as brief as a short story.  The catered meals were a great excuse to step away from our screens and unwind a little bit.  By the end of the day our brains were ready to be done.  Ten hours of solid concentration is challenging!

I think the swag went over well too.  I ordered [custom "Writer Rally Lansing 2013" journals][2] and clipped a [fountain pen][3] to each one.  I think the fountain pens were a big hit.  I got the impression that many of the attendees had never owned or written with one before so it had a pleasant novelty to it.  Everyone also got to choose a poster from [The Oatmeal Grammar Pack][4] to take home with them.

So how much did we actually write today?  We have one first draft and six other stories well on their way.  Of those seven stories, six were shared with me via Dropbox.  Of those there is a a total of 16,439 words!  I published these stories and story fragments into a preview version of the book.  I chose paperback-sized pages (4.25" x 6.87") and an 11 point font.  The result was 89 magnificent pages.

I hope that tomorrow we get a similar turn-out and even more first drafts.  I'll be sure to let you all know!
