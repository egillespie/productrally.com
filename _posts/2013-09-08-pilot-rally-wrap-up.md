We reached the end of day two of Writer Rally Lansing 2013 with a lot of success.  Nearly all of the works-in-progress reached their first draft.  As we're standing right now, we have a total of 26,545 words on 126 paperback-sized pages.  Not too shabby for two days of work!

By the end of the day everyone was exhausted.  We wrapped up the bulk of the writing early today to give us time to do some editing and proofreading for the other authors.  We're also doing a vote for best story amongst our group.  The winner will receive a leather-bound journal hand-made by [Poetic Earth Journals][1].  We also had a dedicated editor attend today.  We were able to keep him busy and he left with the book [Eats, Shoots and Leaves][2] by Lynne Truss.

I am kicking myself a little bit after forgetting not once, but twice today to take a picture of the group.  The basement felt alive today as everyone wrapped up their stories and talked openly about them.  I would have loved to capture some of that in a picture.

The team has been inspired by the event and would like to keep working on our book.  After this weekend we are going to continue reading each others' pieces and editing them until everyone has a final draft.  Then we get to talk about actually publishing.  Let's keep our fingers crossed!

This weekend was really great.  I'm so happy with the amount of writing we did and I think everyone had a great time.  This weekend was a huge success in my eyes and I will definitely organize another one.

For those of you who attended: Thank You!  This couldn't have happened without your support and energy.  I'm so proud of what we have all accomplished!
