Over the past few weeks we have been doing some recruiting, looking for people who have an interest in writing stories and who are as excited as we are to try and write a book in an absolutely ridiculous amount of time.  We have gathered a crew of about a dozen people and polled them about which genre of fiction they would be interested in writing.  The votes were almost unanimously in favor of writing Science Fiction / Fantasy.  We have a team and we have a theme!

In order to get everyone ready for the rally, a [MailChimp][1] campaign has been created in order to broadcast updates to the team and solicit feedback.  If you suffer from FOMO, fear not!  General updates will still be posted to this blog and and those updates will be occurring on a much more frequent basis as we approach the weekend of the rally.

Also, while the recruiting phase is technically finished, if you are interested in participating please do not hesitate to [send an email][2] and let us know you're interested.  We can more than likely make room for one or two more participants.
