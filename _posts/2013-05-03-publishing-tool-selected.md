For a single author, trying to write a book in a weekend is a monumental task in and of itself.  Adding more authors can help make this task more achievable by distributing the writing and editing effort but it also introduces some new problems, many of which have something to do with coordination.  At Writer Rallies it will be important to make sure everyone on a project is using the same set of tools to establish a basis for any coordination that needs to happen.  The suite of tools used cannot get in the way of authors while they are writing, they must make it easy for contributors to edit each others' work, and publishing to common electronic formats should be completely automatic.

During a Product Rally, participants should be able to work on their ideas unimpeded.  The tools used should lightweight but powerful.  They should not remove impediments, they should prevent those impediments from appearing in the first place.  Finally, they should feel comfortable when used in the highly collaborative environment of a Product Rally.

Recently, I came across [an article on TidBITS][1] about rapid book publishing using a software service named [Leanpub][2].  Publishing is certainly a major component to producing a book start to finish and doing so quickly would be pertinent to authors at a Writer Rally.  I read through the article and was amazed at what I had stumbled upon.

Leanpub is built upon the concepts of the [Lean Publishing Manifesto][3], a public statement that attempts to solve many common problems that publishers <strong>and</strong> authors encounter.  Please, read through this manifesto.  You'll see like I did that it addresses many of the perceived issues that groups at a Writer Rally could run into.  Not only that, but Leanpub is more than a publishing tool.  It uses [Dropbox][4] to share the files that will ultimately be used to publish the book.  This makes it easy for an author to always be contributing to their work.  It enables an author to easily share their writing with editors and quickly receive feedback from readers.  It makes writing, editing, and publishing a book collaborative.

A group of authors making frequent contributions to a single book has other issues besides needing a common way to share and publish files though.  In order for everyone to share their work they must first agree upon a common format for writing.  Leanpub tackles this problem by using [Markdown][5] language.  This language is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format that can be easily converted to HTML.  It doesn't matter if you use Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, or any other operating system.  If you have a basic text editor, you can write Markdown.  Because the format is so simple, Leanpub can easily use it to produce a number of electronic formats that are common for book publishing (PDF, EPUB, and MOBI).

The way that the Markdown files are organized within a shared Dropbox that Leanpub creates for you also makes it easy to piece together a single book from a potentially large number of sources/contributors.  If an author preferred, they could write the whole book in a single file.  Leanpub offers a way to list a number of files that will be used to piece together the book though.  This means that each chapter of a book could be a separate file.  I think this will work well for the pilot rally because we will be able to publish the full collection of short stories continuously throughout the rally.

I've decided to give Leanpub a try for the pilot Writer Rally.  Besides addressing a lot of the needs for easy coordination, it is also free to use and will allow participants to use effectively any Internet-connected computer they want.  There are a good number of free or cheap Markdown editors available for all of the popular operating systems and Dropbox is also free and cross-platform.

Now that there is finally a solid detail about the pilot rally, I'm going to create a reference for participants to help them prepare for the rally.  I also have some unanswered questions that I need to figure out.  Foremost is choosing a weekend for the pilot.  Beyond that there are still some matters of coordination that I need to figure out such as how I can seek out interest, how to contact participants en masse, change tracking (useful once editing of a story begins), other rally activities (kick-off and closing presentations, tool tutorials, assessment/feedback), room and board, meals, and so on.

My work is definitely cut out for me.  If you are interested in helping or participating, please [email me][6] or comment right here!  I'd appreciate feedback too, good or bad.  I'd like to know that I'm working on something that more than just myself is interested in and if there are any criticisms I would like to try and address those as well.

Until next time!
