We are kicking off the first ever Product Rally in Lansing, Michigan this year and the target attendee is: writers!

The Writer Rally was chosen to be the pilot because the idea of a convention where people with similar interests actually work together to produce something tangible evolved from the more basic idea of hosting a weekend-long party where friends get together and write short stories, edit each others' pieces, and then compile the material into a publishable book.

That being said, the pilot will be small.  It will probably have only one group working collectively on a single book.  Because this is the pilot, there will be a lot of learning and planning on our part to get even a small rally going.  We will be making decisions about important items such as the date and venue of course, but we also have to decide how to structure the event, exactly how many people we can allow, what kinds of metrics do we need in order to determine if the convention is a success (assuming there will be more to it than just creating a file with the contents of a book).  How do we get feedback from attendees?  Do we need sponsors?  Or since this is just a small pilot, do we forego these questions and make a determination of what we need after the fact?

So there will be a lot of learning and planning and compromising.  We realize that a lot of the questions we have are logistical in nature.  Ultimately though, answering those questions is not nearly as important as bringing people together and having a great time while creating something spectacular!

In the coming weeks we'll be doing more work organizing this website and filling in some of the details about Writer Rally Lansing 2013.  We'll keep this site up to date with the latest news.  If you discover this site and are interested to learn more or have suggestions, feel free to contact us!

For now, stay tuned!
