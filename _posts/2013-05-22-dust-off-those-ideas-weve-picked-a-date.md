The summer months are a busy time for us all, so we've picked a date just before fall begins.  Hopefully this is ample time for everyone who wants to participate to clear their schedule and start brainstorming ideas to contribute to the book we are going to create!  So here it, the weekend of the first rally:

###### Writer Rally Lansing 2013
###### September 7-8

If you are interested in joining us to collaboratively write a whole book in a weekend then mark this date on your calendar! The next handful of posts will be tailored toward signing up for this event and narrowing down how we can accomplish the crazy feat of writing, editing, and publishing all in two days.

For now, if you are interested in participating, feel free to let me know in any way you can. [Email me][1], let me know first hand, etc.
