I recently compiled a bunch of research that I have done about writing and sent it to the Writer Rally Lansing 2013 team.  I feel like this info is useful for more than just the team though so I figured I would touch it up, generalize it a bit, and share it with the world.

The first recommendation I have made to writers is to jot down important elements of your story idea as an outline.  The idea is to capture details such as character names, places, and important plot elements.  This way you don't have to come up with those sorts of details while you are at your computer trying to type.

I also recommend telling your story idea to a few friends that you know will give you good feedback.  This tip is useful for making sure there are no glaring plot holes that you may missed and to make sure that your story would flow well.  If you can't explain the idea to a friend, you'll probably have an even more difficult time writing it out.

## Character Development

Stories almost always revolve around characters.  And while your plot is vital to the overall telling of a story, it is the characters involved in that plot who drive the story towards its climax and resolution.  A character's personality, background, goals, mannerisms, appearance... all of these and more can affect the resolution of your story.  Think about the characters that will be critical to your story.  There are usually two or three.  Write detailed notes about each one of them.

Last fall I attended a workshop about writing a novel.  The workshop was hosted by an author of dozens of books including a variety of Star Wars, BattleTech, and other sci-fi/fantasy novels.  He recommended developing the details about two or more main characters.  Then, he recommended writing a letter as if it were written from one character to another.  The presenter also suggested creating a conversation between two characters.  The focus should be on details such as how other characters would react if they witnessed or overheard the communication.  Be specific.  For example, was it actually a letter or was it an email or series of text messages?  Where was the conversation held and what was the weather like at the time?

The idea is to know your characters so intimately that when it comes time to commit them to your story, you can do so effortlessly.

## Developing the World

Characters need a world to exist in.  This world will influence the characters by hindering and aiding them.  On the flip side, the world can also be influenced by your characters.  Try to describe how the world would be affected if each character were to achieve an important goal that they have.  What would happen to this world if the character failed?  In either case, will the world resist these changes?

Describe how your characters are rooted in the world.  How are their personalities and possessions influenced by the world, their environment, or past events?  Do the characters have a safe place in this world?  Write notes about these details and always try to think about how the other characters would be affected if they were in the same place or situation.

## Plot and Story Structure

The [Snowflake Method for Designing a Novel][1] also has good advice for developing your plot.  Even if you are writing short stories, the advice offered on this site can still be applied.

One exercise recommended by this method is to write a single, brief sentence describing your whole story.  Newspapers do this for every article and as the author of the Snowflake Method points out:  writing these one-liners is an art form.  This tip will help you think about your story in ways that will both help expand on your original idea and to reduce the overall scope to a single idea.

The host of the workshop I attended last fall has two of his own suggestions for developing a plot.  First, he recommends scratching out a number of scenes (a scene is something that a character does) that span the whole plot of your story.  Then, take all of these scenes and place them on a timeline.  Review this timeline and ask yourself the following questions:  Which events and scenes are caused by others?  Can any of the scenes happen at the same time?  Where can I combine, split, or add new scenes?

Second, think about your plot in terms of conflict and resolution.  Choose four of the five scenes below to include in your story.  Scenes four and five are all about character development.

1. A scene will show to the reader that there is a problem.
2. A scene will reveal to a character that there is a problem.
3. A scene will catalyze a character into acting on the problem and explain why they rising to action.
4. A scene will occur that details a character building or developing the resources to resolve the problem.
5. A scene will describe the difficulties in resolving the problem.  Alternatively, the character won't resolve the problem and will have to go back to scene 4.
